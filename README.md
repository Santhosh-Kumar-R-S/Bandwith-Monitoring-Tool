# Bandwidth Monitoring Tool
## Real-Time Network Monitoring

This project implements a real-time bandwidth monitoring tool using Python. It tracks upload and download speeds and provides a user-friendly graphical interface.

## Features
- **Real-Time Bandwidth Tracking:** Uses `psutil` to monitor internet speed.
- **Graphical Interface:** Provides both Tkinter (basic UI) and PyQt6 (modern UI) versions.
- **Internet Speed Testing:** Uses `speedtest-cli` to measure network performance.
- **Logging System (Future Feature):** Tracks bandwidth usage over time.
- **Low Resource Consumption:** Runs efficiently without affecting performance.
- **Cross-Platform:** Works on Windows, Linux, and MacOS.

## Installation
Ensure you have Python installed and install dependencies using:
```bash
pip install psutil speedtest-cli PyQt6
```

## <b>The script:</b>

<ul> <li>Monitors real-time upload and download speeds.<br> <li>Provides a graphical interface for easy visualization.<br> <li>Tests internet speed using `speedtest-cli`.<br> <li>Runs efficiently across multiple platforms.<br> </ul>

## Output

<ul> <li>Real-time upload and download speeds displayed in the UI. <li>Internet speed test results. 
<ol>
  <li>Download Bnadwidth Speed Testing Results</li><br>
